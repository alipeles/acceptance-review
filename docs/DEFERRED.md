# The bundled queue

Things found mid-iteration that were deliberately not acted on at the time.
Claude queues here instead of interrupting; the queue is presented at the next
gate and worked with `/triage`. See `CLAUDE.md` *Working agreement* §4.

Entries are never deleted — a closed entry keeps its record.

Kind: `defect` (a bug, smell, missing test, spec inconsistency, dependency
problem, outside the current task's scope) · `filing` (a drafted issue,
sub-issue, or comment asserting a new finding — nothing reaches GitHub until
approved at a gate) · `decision` (an open design decision, with the
recommendation and the alternative rejected).

Severity: `blocker` (an Acceptance item of the task in flight depends on it) ·
`should-fix` (real defect, no Acceptance item blocked) ·
`nice-to-have` (cleanup, ergonomics, docs).

### [YYYY-MM-DD] <one-line title>
- **Kind:** defect | filing | decision
- **Found during:** #144, Gate 1
- **Where:** src/acceptance/requirement/obligations.py:118
- **Severity:** blocker | should-fix | nice-to-have
- **What's wrong:** one or two concrete sentences.
- **Why I didn't act:** out of scope for #144 / would change the review-state schema.
- **Drafted fix:** for a defect, what you would do — specific enough to approve or
  reject without a follow-up, with the diff sketch if it is small. For a filing, the
  issue body as it would be filed, its labels, and its parent umbrella.
- **Status:** open
